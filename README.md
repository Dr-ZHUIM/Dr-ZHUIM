### Bonjour! ä½ å¥½! ðŸ‘‹

Hi! My name is Dr.Zhuim (if you want, you can also call me FranÃ§ois, that's my French name), a front-end engineer of China in Wuxi, majoring in FranÃ§ais.

My dream is making my every engrossing idea come true. I focus on developing application based on React or React-Native. At my next goal, I will figure out the Vite and create some fantastic Vite plugins for a bigger improvement.

Outside of programming, i enjoy doing paints and travaling. If you are interested in travaling too, let's share photos or memories with each other!

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Nest.js and React.js.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Vite plugins.
